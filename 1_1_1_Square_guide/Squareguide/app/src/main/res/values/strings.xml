    <string name="description">There is a heart of a city Petrozavodsk which is on the Gagarin square. This is a small but important area of the city, because it is a first impression when you come from a railway station. Railway station is a yellow building on the right. It is a monument of architecture, however there is not really interesting things to know. On the left there is a new Hotel with bars, restaurantes and parking places. There is a tiny park in the center of the square with little big ban clock in the middle. The main street of Petrozavodsk starts from this square, the name of a street is a Lenin street.</string>
